# Kubernetes for Unraid and Proxmox VE

This project was created for educational purposes, it is not intended for
production use of any kind.

I needed to re-learn Ansible after being away for some time üòÆ‚Äçüí® but also start
familiarising myself with the OpenShift platform.

Note: For OpenShift I am using [OKD](https://okd.io) with Fedora Core images,
not RedHat OpenShift on RHEL. The concept probably works for either.

This code currently allows the deployment of a HA or non-HA cluster on either
[Proxmox VE](https://proxmox.com/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview)
or [Unraid](https://unraid.net), the two platforms available to me in my home
lab. For these two platforms I am mostly relying on the available packages
for the OS, which is more important for Unraid which does not have any form of
standard package management.

- üöß Consider this project a work-in-progress
- üö® Error handling has not been fully tested
- üò≠ I offer no guarantees that this code won't cause you some kind of grief
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider yourself warned

## How to use?

I make use of [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to keep things contained. There are
other tools that work with Python, so feel free to use whatever, with whatever
on whatever that makes sense to you.

1. Install mise `brew install mise` _(optional)_
1. Download your pull secret: https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret
1. Place the text file in this folder (it is git-ignored)
1. If you are using mise, run `mise trust` in this folder _(optional)_
1. Install Ansible requirements `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`
1. Adjust the files below to suit your environment:
   - `host_vars/*`
   - `inventory/*`
   - `loadbalancer/defaults/main.yml`
   - `okd-cluster/defaults/main.yml`

‚ö†Ô∏è Please give special attention to `kube_config_dest` as any existing file
will be overwritten ‚ö†Ô∏è

There are two main playbooks, use with:

- `--limit` targets desired host group (`pve` or `unraid`)
- `--tags` to choose flavour of kubernetes (currently only `okd`)

e.g.

```sh
# Deploy an OpenShift cluster on Proxmox VE
ansible-playbook create.yml --limit pve --tags okd

# Remove any deployed infra on Unraid with optional retention of downloads
ansible-playbook destroy.yml --limit unraid --extra-vars "persistence_cleanup=false"
```
